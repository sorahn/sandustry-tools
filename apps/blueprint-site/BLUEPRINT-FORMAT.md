# Supported blueprint formats

The renderer and shared `@daryl.roberts/sandustry-blueprint-core` package accept the current
v2 blueprint prefixes:

- `SAND:BP:v2:` contains base64-encoded binary data.
- `SAND:BP:v2t:` contains the same binary data as comma-separated byte values.

The first binary byte is the internal format version. The current decoder
accepts versions 2, 3, and 4. Version 4 may include signal links after the
structure records; versions 2 and 3 do not have that section.

The binary payload contains, in order:

1. Blueprint name.
2. A dictionary of numeric native IDs or string mod IDs. Record bytes can
   address only the first 64 entries; the game currently exports larger
   dictionaries for some prefab-heavy blueprints but collapses records beyond
   that range to type index 0.
3. Structure records containing dictionary index, coordinates, optional filter,
   and optional arbitrary JSON data.
4. For version 4, signal links containing source and target coordinates and an
   enabled flag.

Unknown numeric and string IDs are valid and must survive decode/re-encode when
their dictionary index is representable. Oversized game-export dictionaries
cannot preserve the original identity of records that the game collapsed to
index 0, but their structure data remains available.
The normalized model is:

```ts
type Blueprint = {
  name: string;
  data: Array<{
    type: string | number;
    x: number;
    y: number;
    filter?: Record<string, unknown>;
    data?: unknown;
  }>;
  signalLinks: Array<{
    from: { x: number; y: number };
    to: { x: number; y: number };
    on: boolean;
  }> | null;
};
```

Legacy `SAND:BACKUP:v1:` strings are not renderer input. The browser conversion
tool supports them through a separate compatibility adapter and can explicitly
encode normalized JSON back to v1. The older `SAND:BP:v1:` spelling is accepted
as a decode-only alias. Worker and Discord renderer integrations must reject v1
rather than silently converting it.

Malformed or truncated payloads, invalid base64, invalid text bytes, unknown
prefixes, unsupported binary versions, invalid type indexes, and invalid JSON
fields are reported as decode errors.
