# Game UI component catalog

This is a working catalog of UI components found in the checked-in Sandustry
references. It is intended to guide `packages/sandustry-ui`, not to reproduce
the game's private React implementation.

## Evidence levels

- **DOM** — directly visible in `resources/filter-html.html`.
- **Bundle** — component names, labels, Tailwind class strings, or interaction
  hooks found in a captured or freshly extracted Sandustry renderer bundle.
- **Inferred** — a reusable component hypothesis based on the evidence above;
  it needs a future DOM capture before being treated as visually authoritative.

The bundle is minified and contains both game UI and renderer/debug tooling.
For current investigations, run the native catalog extractor; it resolves the
installed game's `app.asar` and extracts the renderer bundle with
`@electron/asar`. The checked-in references below are historical captures and
are not required for extraction. Where there is no captured DOM, this catalog
records the likely purpose rather than claiming an exact visual
implementation.

## Visual foundation

| Component/pattern      | Evidence    | What it appears to be for                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Likely reusable React kit mapping

The first version of `packages/sandustry-ui` should not expose every game name
as a component. A smaller reusable vocabulary can cover most of the observed
surface:

```text
AppShell
TopBar / Sidebar / NavigationTabs
Panel / Card / Section / Inspector
Button / IconButton / ButtonGroup / SegmentedControl
Input / SearchInput / Select / Checkbox / Radio / Switch / Slider
Badge / Chip / StatusDot / Keycap / ResourceAmount
Dialog / Drawer / Popover / Tooltip / Toast / Alert
ProgressBar / Meter / Spinner / Skeleton / EmptyState / ErrorState
List / Tree / Table / DataGrid / Pagination
Tabs / Breadcrumbs / Stepper / CommandPalette
Hotbar / HotbarSlot / InventoryGrid / ItemCard
ElementPicker / FilterPanel / BuildModeToolbar
BlueprintBrowser / BlueprintInspector / BlueprintCanvas
DebugInspector / KeyValueList / CollapsibleGroup
```

The game-specific controls should be layered on top of the general controls.
For example, `ElementPicker` can compose `SearchInput`, `SegmentedControl`,
`ItemCard`, `StatusDot`, and `EmptyState` rather than introducing a separate
styling system.

## Reference gaps to fill with future DOM captures

The highest-value captures would be:

1. Main menu and in-world application shell.
2. Settings tabs and each control type.
3. Build/inventory panel in open, selected, unavailable, and search states.
4. Structure tooltip and native Filter/Sound Box configuration panels.
5. Blueprint browser, save dialog, import/export, and workshop upload states.
6. Notifications, errors, loading, and cancelable progress states.
7. Debug inspector open, collapsed, selected, and empty states.
8. Controller-focused states and directional navigation behavior.

## Sources inspected

- `resources/filter-html.html` — direct DOM snapshot of filter and hotbar UI.
- `scripts/extract-native-catalog.mjs` — extracts the current renderer bundle
  from the installed `app.asar` with `@electron/asar`.
- `resources/bundle.js` — historical minified production-bundle capture with UI
  strings, Tailwind class names, overlay names, and interaction identifiers.
- `resources/sandustry-mod-settings-guide.md` — settings tab and schema
  behavior inferred from the bundle.
- `resources/v1/debug-info/` — debug settings and developer-tool context.
- `resources/custom-maps.md` — map-related manifest and file concepts.

This catalog should be updated when new DOM examples arrive. New observations
should be labeled with their source and interaction state before they influence
the shared component API.
